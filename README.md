# ChunkyTown

My first project in C++, with OpenGL.

This project was a semester project, so it was completed in about 15 weeks, in a team of two.

It was carried out during the third semester of my software development program.

## Project Overview

The goal of the project was to evolve the game throughout the session, also serving as a learning experience for C++ and OpenGL.

While the project had specific objectives, we were also given the freedom to make creative choices during the design phase.
